<blockquote>O Muse, pray sing to me of GitHub tools,
That I may make anew a page online.
The lessons taken here shall be as jewels,
And wisdom's teachings passed from thee to mine.

Now first, a new account make for this class,
On GitHub.com where we lay our scene.
A repo next, account name picked to pass,
Add then the name, so follow these steps keen:

Account name here, plus github, dot io.
To save the "index" lets a page display,
It must be ended .html,
And navigation's easy done this way.

For now, save content via Github page,
And soon you'll gain the tools and leave this cage.</blockquote>
